## AI Chatbots vs. AI Agents: What’s the Difference, and Why It Matters
**Date:** Mar 3, 2025
**Link:** [Read on Medium](https://imtiaan.medium.com/ai-chatbots-vs-ai-agents-whats-the-difference-and-why-it-matters-b6ca0c8811e8)

Artificial Intelligence is reshaping how businesses operate, but not all AI is created equal. Two terms you’ll often hear are “AI chatbots” (typically part of workflows) and “AI agents.” While both can streamline tasks and boost efficiency, they’re quite different beasts under the hood. Understanding these differences is key to unlocking the full potential of AI for your organisation  -  and that’s where Bottler comes in. Let’s break it down.

### What Are AI Chatbots in Workflows?

AI chatbots, often embedded in workflows, are designed to handle specific, repetitive tasks with precision. Think of them as reliable digital assistants following a clear script. They’re rule-based, operating within set parameters to tackle predictable jobs  -  perfect for automating the everyday grind.

**What They’re Good At:**

- **Routine Tasks**: From data entry and invoice processing to answering FAQs, chatbots excel at keeping things ticking over smoothly.
- **Basic Communication**: They can handle simple customer queries or guide users through straightforward processes  -  like resetting a password or booking a meeting.
- **Data Handling**: Extracting info from emails or forms and plugging it into systems is their bread and butter.

**Where They Fall Short:**

- **Limited Flexibility**: Chatbots struggle when faced with unexpected curveballs or queries outside their script. They’re not big on thinking on their feet.
- **Surface-Level Understanding**: Complex questions or nuanced language can trip them up, leading to unhelpful responses.
- **No Learning Curve**: They don’t adapt or improve over time  -  they stick to what they’re programmed to do.

In short, chatbots in workflows are brilliant for consistency and speed in structured settings, but they’re not built for the unpredictable or the complex.

### What Are True AI Agents?

Now, step up to AI agents  -  the next level of intelligence. These aren’t just task-runners; they’re autonomous thinkers capable of reasoning, learning, and adapting. Rather than following a rigid playbook, AI agents can navigate dynamic situations, make decisions, and even interact with their environment to achieve goals.

**What Sets Them Apart:**

- **Autonomy**: Agents can analyse situations, weigh options, and act independently  -  no constant hand-holding required.
- **Complex Problem-Solving**: They tackle multi-step challenges, adjusting their approach as needed, whether it’s troubleshooting or strategising.
- **Contextual Smarts**: They grasp the bigger picture, understanding nuance and maintaining meaningful conversations over time.
- **Learning Power**: AI agents get better with experience, refining their skills as they go.

**The Trade-Offs:**

- **Slightly Slower**: Their depth of thinking can mean they’re not as lightning-fast as chatbots for simple tasks.
- **Complexity**: They need robust systems and data to shine, which can be trickier to set up.

AI agents are your go-to for adaptability and tackling the thornier, less predictable challenges businesses face  -  like personalising customer experiences or analysing sprawling datasets.

### Chatbots vs. Agents: When to Use What?

- **Pick a Chatbot Workflow For**: Repetitive, high-volume tasks where consistency is king  -  think customer service FAQs or automating HR onboarding steps.
- **Opt for an AI Agent When**: You need adaptability and deeper problem-solving, like managing real-time crises or curating tailored recommendations.

The catch? While chatbots are fairly straightforward to deploy, true AI agents often demand more technical know-how, infrastructure, time and money  -  until now.

The FinTech industry has come a long way since its inception and has revolutionised the financial sector with its innovations and technologies. In this comprehensive guide, we take a closer look at the history and evolution of the FinTech industry, exploring the key events and milestones that have shaped its growth.

### The Origins of Fintech

FinTech refers to the use of technology to improve and automate financial services. The term was first coined in the 1990s, but the roots of fintech can be traced back to the invention of computers and the internet.

As early as the 1960s, computers were being used in financial institutions for tasks such as record-keeping and accounting. In the 1970s and 1980s, ATMs and credit card systems were introduced, further automating financial services.

### The Emergence of Online Banking

The rise of online banking marked a major turning point in the evolution of fintech. With the advent of the internet in the late 1990s, banks were able to offer their customers new services such as online bill payment, account management, and money transfers.

One of the first online banks was First Direct, which was established in the UK in 1989. Over the next decade, many other banks around the world began to offer online banking services to their customers.

### The Growth of Mobile Banking

With the widespread adoption of smartphones, the FinTech industry has continued to evolve and expand. Mobile banking has emerged as one of the most popular and convenient ways for customers to manage their finances, with millions of people now using their smartphones to check their accounts, pay bills, and transfer money.

The first mobile banking services were launched in the early 2000s, and the adoption of these services has continued to grow in recent years. In 2018, mobile banking surpassed online banking as the most popular way for customers to access their accounts.

### The Rise of FinTech Startups

In recent years, the FinTech industry has seen a surge in the number of startups and innovative companies offering new and improved financial services. These companies are leveraging technology to offer services that are faster, more convenient, and more accessible than traditional banking.

One of the first FinTech startups was PayPal, which was founded in 1998 and quickly became one of the largest online payment platforms in the world.

## Understanding the Importance of Lightning Network for Bitcoin
**Date:** Feb 7, 2023
**Link:** [Read on Medium](https://imtiaan.medium.com/understanding-the-importance-of-lightning-network-for-bitcoin-29f4bc144933)

Bitcoin, the only important decentralised digital currency, has come a long way since its inception in 2009. Despite its popularity and widespread adoption, the Bitcoin network still faces several challenges, particularly with regards to scalability and speed. The Lightning Network is a proposed solution to these issues, offering a new way for Bitcoin transactions to be processed more quickly and efficiently.

### What is Lightning Network?

The Lightning Network is a second-layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin network. It operates as a decentralized network of payment channels that allow users to transact directly with each other, without having to broadcast every transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. This results in a significant reduction in transaction fees and increased transaction speed, as the Lightning Network is able to process transactions much more quickly than the traditional Bitcoin network.

### How Does Lightning Network Work?

The Lightning Network works by establishing payment channels between users. These channels allow users to transact with each other, without having to broadcast each transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed by the Bitcoin network, which in turn reduces the processing time for each transaction. The Lightning Network also allows for multi-party transactions, enabling users to transact with multiple parties simultaneously, further reducing the processing time and fees associated with each transaction.

### Benefits of Lightning Network

The Lightning Network offers several benefits over the traditional Bitcoin network, including:

1. **Increased Scalability**: The Lightning Network is able to process a much larger number of transactions per second, compared to the traditional Bitcoin network, making it a more scalable solution for the growing demand for Bitcoin transactions.
2. **(considerably) Reduced Transaction Fees**: The Lightning Network allows for direct transactions between users, which reduces the need for intermediaries and results in lower transaction fees.
3. **(much) Faster Transactions**: The Lightning Network is able to process transactions much more quickly than the traditional Bitcoin network, allowing for near-instant transactions.
4. **Increased Privacy:** The Lightning Network operates as a decentralized network of payment channels, which makes it more difficult for third parties to track and intercept transactions.

### Challenges with Lightning Network

Despite its numerous benefits, the Lightning Network is not without its challenges. Some of the key challenges include:

1. **Complexity**: The Lightning Network is a complex system that requires a high degree of technical expertise to set up and use.
2. **Liquidity**: The Lightning Network relies on sufficient liquidity in payment channels to function effectively. If there is not enough liquidity, users may have difficulty finding payment channels to transact through.
3. **Security**: The Lightning Network operates as a decentralised network of payment channels, making it susceptible to security vulnerabilities such as malicious nodes and network attacks.

### Conclusion

The Lightning Network is a promising solution to the scalability and speed issues faced by the traditional Bitcoin network. By allowing for direct transactions between users, reducing transaction fees and increasing transaction speed, the Lightning Network offers a more efficient and cost-effective way to use Bitcoin.

However, the Lightning Network is not without its challenges, and it will require continued development and refinement to overcome these challenges and become a widely adopted solution for the Bitcoin network.

In conclusion, the Lightning Network represents an important step forward for the future of Bitcoin and offers the potential to solve many of the challenges faced by the Bitcoin network (mainnet).

## The importance of first principles when building financial products
**Date:** Feb 16, 2023
**Link:** [Read on Medium](https://imtiaan.medium.com/the-importance-of-first-principles-when-building-financial-products-ff38ac076c53)

Building financial products is a complex process that requires careful planning and attention to detail. With so many variables and moving parts, it’s easy to get lost in the weeds and lose sight of the big picture. That’s where first principles come in.

First principles thinking is a powerful problem-solving technique that involves breaking a problem down to its most fundamental components and working from there. By doing this, you can strip away all the noise and distractions and focus on what really matters.

In the context of financial product design, first principles thinking is essential. Here are a few reasons why:

**_It helps you identify the core problem you’re trying to solve_**

When you approach a problem with a first principles mindset, you begin by asking yourself, “What is the core problem here?” This helps you cut through all the noise and distractions and focus on the essential issue that needs to be addressed.

For example, let’s say you’re designing a new investment platform. Instead of starting with the features and functionality you want to include, you start by asking yourself, “What is the core problem investors are facing that we can solve with this platform?” Maybe it’s the high fees and commissions charged by traditional brokerages, or the lack of transparency in the investment process. By identifying the core problem, you can design a product that truly addresses the needs of your target market.

**_It helps you avoid copying others and creating me-too products_**

In the financial industry, it’s easy to fall into the trap of copying what others are doing. After all, if something is working for your competitors, it must be a good idea, right?

Not necessarily. By approaching product design with a first principles mindset, you can avoid falling into this trap. Instead of copying what others are doing, you can focus on creating something truly unique and innovative that meets the needs of your target market in a way that no one else is.

Be original, innovate, you have the advantage of fresh eyes, so use it. And if you really have to copy, make it considerably better. The amount of learnings you lose when copying someone else can be the difference between success and failure, the work you copied came with a lot of decision making, and by copying you don’t know why decisions were made, so you risk making the same mistakes they did.

**_It helps you future-proof your product_**

Financial products are subject to a constantly changing regulatory environment. What was compliant yesterday may not be compliant tomorrow. By designing your product with first principles in mind, you can future-proof it and ensure that it will continue to meet regulatory requirements and customer needs for years to come with as little business and development impact as possible.

**_It helps you create a more user-friendly product_**

One of the core principles of first principles thinking is simplicity. By stripping away all the unnecessary bells and whistles, you can create a product that is easy to use and understand. This is especially important in the financial industry, where many products are needlessly complex and difficult for the average user to navigate.

By designing your product with simplicity in mind, you can create a more user-friendly experience that will be more appealing to your target market.

If we expand on this further, and you consider first principles from the perspective of a customer who has never been exposed to financial products, you have a customer who would be turned off by too much complexity, so the simpler your product, the more accessible it is, the more accessible, the more opportunity you create for your Fintech, and for your customers.

It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have advanced features though, they should just not be a requirement to engage with the core features of your product.

**_It helps you stay true to your company’s values and mission_**

Every company has a unique set of values and a mission that guides its decision-making. By using first principles thinking, you can ensure that your product design is aligned with these values and mission. This helps you create a product that is not only successful in the marketplace, but also one that your company can be proud of.

So if you’re working to make financial products accessible the approach you take will be vastly different than building a FinTech that works purely off an API for advanced customers, or institutions.

### In addition to the above points, there are a few other key factors to keep in mind when using first principles thinking in financial product design.

**One is the importance of research**. Before you can identify the core problem you're trying to solve, you need to have a deep understanding of your target market and their needs. This requires thorough research, including interviews with potential customers, analysis of competitors and market trends, and a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory environment.

You also need to test the understanding of who you think your customers might be and what their needs are with things like user testing, but that’s a little later on. You do however need to test your target market and features against the vision and mission of the company.

**Another key factor is collaboration**. Financial product design is a team sport, and its important to involve all relevant stakeholders in the process, including designers, developers, compliance experts, and marketing professionals. By working together and sharing ideas, you can ensure that your product design is comprehensive and meets the needs of all parties involved.

**Finally, its important to keep an eye on the bigger picture.** Financial products don’t exist in a vacuum  -  they’re part of a broader ecosystem that includes customers, competitors, regulators, and other stakeholders. By considering the broader context in which your product will exist, you can ensure that it fits into the larger picture and is set up for success.

Ultimately, the importance of first principles thinking in financial product design cannot be overstated. By using this powerful problem-solving technique, you can create products that truly meet the needs of your target market, are aligned with your company’s values and mission, and stand the test of time. With so much at stake in the financial industry, theres no room for anything less. This is peoples money.

In conclusion, first principles thinking is an essential tool for anyone involved in the design and development of financial products. By focusing on the core problem, avoiding me-too products, future-proofing your product, creating a more user-friendly experience, and staying true to your company’s values and mission, you can create products that truly meet the needs of your target market and stand the test of time.

## Solving the right problem: Key to building a successful FinTech
**Date:** Feb 21, 2023
**Link:** [Read on Medium](https://imtiaan.medium.com/solving-the-right-problem-key-to-building-a-successful-fintech-445cef6e1bac)

With the emergence of FinTechs, it has become easier to manage finances and access financial services. FinTechs provide innovative solutions to address financial challenges, making financial transactions easier and more convenient for customers.

However, building a successful FinTech requires a deep understanding of the problem you are trying to solve. Identifying the right problem to solve is critical to building a FinTech that resonates with your target market. In this article, we will guide you through the process of identifying the problem youre trying to solve when building a FinTech.

### Understand your target market

To identify the problem you're trying to solve, you first need to understand your target market. Who are they? What are their needs? What are their pain points? What are their goals? Understanding your target market is crucial to building a successful FinTech.

To gain a deep understanding of your target market, you need to conduct thorough research. This research will provide you with valuable insights into your target market, which will help you identify the problem you are trying to solve.

It will also help you understand the general financial circumstances of your target customers which will help you make important budgetary decisions along the way.

### Conduct market research

Market research is a critical component of identifying the problem you're trying to solve. Market research allows you to gather information about the market, including the competitive landscape, market size, growth potential, and further into customer needs.

You can use a variety of tools to do this like surveys, focus groups, interviews, and data analysis. These tools will help you understand the market and identify gaps that your FinTech can fill.

### Analyse your competition

Analysing your competition is an essential step in identifying the problem you're trying to solve. You must understand your competition, their strengths and weaknesses, and the problems they are solving. This analysis will help you identify gaps in the market that you can fill.

When analysing your competition, you should also consider their pricing strategies, marketing campaigns, and customer service. These factors can provide insights into how you can differentiate your FinTech and provide a unique solution to the problem you're trying to solve.  -  Remember, improve, don’t copy.

### Identify the pain points of your customers

To identify the problem you're trying to solve, you must understand the pain points of your customers. What are the challenges they are facing? What are the roadblocks preventing them from achieving their financial goals?

Again, you can use a variety of tools, including surveys, interviews, and social listening. This will help you understand the challenges your customers are facing, and you can use this information to develop a FinTech solution that addresses their pain points.

### Develop a value proposition

Once you have identified the problem you're trying to solve, you must develop a value proposition that clearly communicates the benefits of your FinTech solution. Your value proposition should clearly articulate how your FinTech solution addresses the pain points of your customers and provides a unique solution to their financial challenges.

Your value proposition should be clear, concise, and easily understood by your target market. It should also differentiate your FinTech from your competition and highlight the unique benefits of your solution.

### Final thoughts

Identifying the problem you're trying to solve when building a FinTech is critical to its success and you’ve gotta understand your target market, conduct market research, analyse your competition, identify the pain points of your customers, and develop a value proposition that clearly communicates the benefits of your solution.

By following these steps, you can build a FinTech that resonates with your target market, addresses their pain points, and provides a unique solution to their financial challenges. With the right approach and a deep understanding of your customers, you can build a successful FinTech that outperforms your competitors and provides real value to your customers.

However, it is important to note that identifying the problem youre trying to solve is _just_ the first step in building a successful FinTech. You must also develop a solid business plan, build a strong team, and continuously iterate and improve your product based on customer feedback.

You also need to pay attention to regulatory requirements and comply with them. FinTechs are subject to various regulations, and failure to comply with these regulations can result in fines or other legal consequences.

Building a successful FinTech requires a lot of hard work, dedication, and continuous improvement. By focusing on your customers, paying attention to regulatory requirements, and building a strong team, you can build a FinTech that makes a real difference in the lives of your customers and helps them achieve their financial goals.
