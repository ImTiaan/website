History is written by the victors, but in crypto, it is usually written by the survivors.

If you look at the stablecoin market today, it looks like a boring, solved problem. You have Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) acting as the digital checking accounts for the entire industry. They are monolithic, centralised, and - boringly - reliable. They work because they rely on the oldest trick in finance: for every digital dollar here, there is a real dollar sitting in a bank vault somewhere (or at least, a very liquid Treasury bill).

But it wasn't always this way.

To understand where we are going - and why the future of money might actually be built on Bitcoin - we have to look back at the graveyard of good intentions. We have to look at the "algo-stables," the DAOs, and the spectral ghosts of projects that promised us decentralised stability and delivered absolute ruin.

### The First Arrow: BitUSD (2014)

Long before DeFi was a buzzword, two of crypto's most controversial figures - Dan Larimer (who went on to found EOS) and Charles Hoskinson (who founded Cardano) - were building **BitShares**.

BitShares was lightyears ahead of its time. It was a delegated proof-of-stake blockchain when Bitcoin was the only game in town. And its crown jewel was **BitUSD**.

The idea was seductive in its purity. There was no bank account. There was no trusting a CEO. 1 BitUSD was pegged to $1 not by cash, but by $2 or $3 worth of the native token, BTS. If the price of BTS dropped, the smart contract (or "market peg" mechanism) would theoretically force a liquidation, selling the BTS to cover the debt and keeping the BitUSD whole.

It was the first attempt at a "crypto-native" dollar. And for a while, it worked.

But BitUSD suffered from a flaw that would haunt every algorithmic stablecoin for the next decade: **The Death Spiral.**

The system relied on the belief that there would always be buyers for the collateral (BTS). But in a true market crash, liquidity evaporates. When BTS tanked, the system tried to sell more BTS to cover the peg. This selling pressure drove the price down further, which triggered more liquidations, which caused more selling.

The peg broke. BitUSD became worth $0.90, then $0.50, then irrelevance. The lesson was brutal: *You cannot back a stable asset with a volatile asset unless you can survive a 99% drawdown.*

### The False Prophet: NuBits (2014)

Around the same time, another contender emerged: **NuBits**.

If BitUSD was an automated machine, NuBits was a digital central bank run by a mob. It didn't rely on over-collateralization. Instead, it relied on "Custodians" (shareholders) who would vote to increase or decrease the supply of NuBits to keep the price at $1.00.

It worked beautifully for a year. The price graph was a flat line. The team was celebrated.

Then, the Bitcoin price crashed. Demand for NuBits evaporated. The "Custodians" couldn't react fast enough. The peg snapped. NuBits crashed to $0.20, then rallied, then crashed again. Today, it trades for pennies - a zombie token reminding us that "DAO governance" is often just a fancy word for "slow, panicked humans."

### The Titan: MakerDAO (2017)

Out of these ashes rose **MakerDAO**.

Maker learned from BitUSD. It launched DAI, a stablecoin backed by Ethereum. But unlike its predecessors, Maker was paranoid. It demanded massive over-collateralization (150%+). It built sophisticated liquidation bots. It created a governance token (MKR) that acted as a lender of last resort - if the system failed, MKR holders would be diluted to pay back the debt.

DAI survived the 2018 crash (where ETH fell 90%). It survived "Black Thursday" in March 2020. It proved that a crypto-backed stablecoin *could* work, but only if it was conservative, slow, and ruthlessly efficient at liquidating its own users.

### The Icarus Moment: Terra (2022)

And then came Do Kwon.

In 2021, the crypto world was seduced by **Terra (UST)**. It mocked the conservatism of MakerDAO. It mocked the centralisation of Tether.

Terra was an algorithmic stablecoin that didn't require over-collateralization. It used a "seigniorage shares" model. If you wanted $1 of UST, you burned $1 of LUNA. If you wanted to exit UST, you burned it to mint $1 of LUNA.

It was perpetual motion. It was alchemy. And to juice the adoption, they built the **Anchor Protocol**, a savings account paying 20% APY.

Billions of dollars flowed in. Normal people put their life savings into Anchor. Funds put their treasury into UST. LUNA became a top-10 asset.

But the math was flawed. The system relied on the market cap of LUNA always being high enough to absorb the exit liquidity of UST.

In May 2022, the music stopped. A few large whales sold UST. The peg wobbled. Panic set in. The algorithm did exactly what it was programmed to do: it printed trillions of LUNA tokens to try and pay back the UST holders.

LUNA supply went from 350 million to 6.5 *trillion* in days. The price went from $80 to $0.000001.

$60 billion of wealth evaporated. It was the "Lehman Brothers" moment of crypto. It brought down hedge funds (Three Arrows Capital), lenders (Celsius, Voyager), and eventually, FTX.

### The Dust Settles

The crash of Terra killed the dream of the "pure" algorithmic stablecoin. Regulators in Europe and the US sharpened their knives (leading to MiCA, which we will discuss in Part II).

But amidst the wreckage, a truth emerged. The market didn't want fancy algorithms. It wanted dollars. Boring, simple, censorship-resistant dollars.

Or, perhaps, it wanted Euros. But nobody was building them.

And while Ethereum has been the home of this innovation, the original king - Bitcoin - has been watching. And waiting.

In Part II, we look at the current hegemony of Tether and Circle, and the regulatory fortress of Europe that is changing the game.
