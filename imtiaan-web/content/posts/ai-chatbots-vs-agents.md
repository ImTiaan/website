Artificial Intelligence is reshaping how businesses operate, but not all AI is created equal. Two terms you’ll often hear are “AI chatbots” (typically part of workflows) and “AI agents.” While both can streamline tasks and boost efficiency, they’re quite different beasts under the hood. Understanding these differences is key to unlocking the full potential of AI for your organisation — and that’s where Bottler comes in. Let’s break it down.

### What Are AI Chatbots in Workflows?

AI chatbots, often embedded in workflows, are designed to handle specific, repetitive tasks with precision. Think of them as reliable digital assistants following a clear script. They’re rule-based, operating within set parameters to tackle predictable jobs — perfect for automating the everyday grind.

**What They’re Good At:**

- **Routine Tasks**: From data entry and invoice processing to answering FAQs, chatbots excel at keeping things ticking over smoothly.
- **Basic Communication**: They can handle simple customer queries or guide users through straightforward processes — like resetting a password or booking a meeting.
- **Data Handling**: Extracting info from emails or forms and plugging it into systems is their bread and butter.

**Where They Fall Short:**

- **Limited Flexibility**: Chatbots struggle when faced with unexpected curveballs or queries outside their script. They’re not big on thinking on their feet.
- **Surface-Level Understanding**: Complex questions or nuanced language can trip them up, leading to unhelpful responses.
- **No Learning Curve**: They don’t adapt or improve over time — they stick to what they’re programmed to do.

In short, chatbots in workflows are brilliant for consistency and speed in structured settings, but they’re not built for the unpredictable or the complex.

### What Are True AI Agents?

Now, step up to AI agents — the next level of intelligence. These aren’t just task-runners; they’re autonomous thinkers capable of reasoning, learning, and adapting. Rather than following a rigid playbook, AI agents can navigate dynamic situations, make decisions, and even interact with their environment to achieve goals.

**What Sets Them Apart:**

- **Autonomy**: Agents can analyse situations, weigh options, and act independently — no constant hand-holding required.
- **Complex Problem-Solving**: They tackle multi-step challenges, adjusting their approach as needed, whether it’s troubleshooting or strategising.
- **Contextual Smarts**: They grasp the bigger picture, understanding nuance and maintaining meaningful conversations over time.
- **Learning Power**: AI agents get better with experience, refining their skills as they go.

**The Trade-Offs:**

- **Slightly Slower**: Their depth of thinking can mean they’re not as lightning-fast as chatbots for simple tasks.
- **Complexity**: They need robust systems and data to shine, which can be trickier to set up.

AI agents are your go-to for adaptability and tackling the thornier, less predictable challenges businesses face — like personalising customer experiences or analysing sprawling datasets.

### Chatbots vs. Agents: When to Use What?

- **Pick a Chatbot Workflow For**: Repetitive, high-volume tasks where consistency is king — think customer service FAQs or automating HR onboarding steps.
- **Opt for an AI Agent When**: You need adaptability and deeper problem-solving, like managing real-time crises or curating tailored recommendations.

The catch? While chatbots are fairly straightforward to deploy, true AI agents often demand more technical know-how, infrastructure, time and money — until now.
